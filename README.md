## Project Description  
&ensp; Haptic Feedback System v2 is a continuation of the idea for a haptic feedback system that allows users or information from touch sensory to travel long distance. This is incredibly useful for particular applications of isolation and feedback systems for games or research. One potential for this project is the ability to "feel" another user touching or playing with a sort of membrane that allows two users to interact across the membrane, sensing each others hands and motion on said membrane.

### Haptic Feedback
&ensp;Unlike the previous itteration that had actually had a haptic feedback system installed directly into the object. this itteration has no literal feedback system. Instead it directly stores data as a json on a live mongodb server. This data is stored and then sent to a live webserver hosting a simple html script that shows the user a rough pixel approximation of where their hand is and the amount of pressure being displayed through color and the console.
&ensp;This could easily be made into two products one of which sends and the other of which recieves this would then make the product tangible in the interaction of the two parts.
This step could then be taken one step further and the two pieces integrated into eachother and then multiplied into two independent systems that communicate with the webserver and grab the others data allowing the two interfaces to interact with eachother.  

&ensp;The design for this concept would look something like the following:
